# Docker vs Kubernetes: When to Use What

## For Your Assignment: **Kubernetes is Required**

Your assignment specifically requested:
- ✅ "Kubernetes YAML manifests"
- ✅ "Each backend service must be independently scalable"
- ✅ "Each successful issuance must return which worker (pod) handled the request"

## When to Use Docker Compose vs Kubernetes

### Use Docker Compose When:
- **Small applications** (1-5 services)
- **Single server deployment**
- **Development/testing environments**
- **Simple scaling requirements**
- **Quick prototypes**
- **Local development**

### Use Kubernetes When:
- **Microservices architecture** (5+ services)
- **Multi-server clusters**
- **Production environments**
- **Auto-scaling requirements**
- **High availability needs**
- **Complex deployment strategies**
- **Service mesh requirements**
- **Enterprise environments**

## Your Project: Perfect for Kubernetes

### Why Kubernetes Fits Your Use Case:

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Issuer service (independently scalable)
   - Verifier service (independently scalable)
   - Frontend service
   - Each can scale based on demand

2. **Worker Identification**
   - Kubernetes pods provide unique names
   - Perfect for "credential issued by worker-xyz" requirement
   - Pod metadata available as environment variables

3. **High Availability**
   - Multiple replicas of each service
   - Self-healing (pods restart if they crash)
   - Rolling updates without downtime

4. **Resource Management**
   - CPU and memory limits/requests
   - Auto-scaling based on resource usage
   - Efficient resource utilization

5. **Service Discovery**
   - Built-in DNS for service communication
   - Load balancing across pod replicas
   - Health checks and readiness probes

## What Your Kubernetes Setup Provides

### Production-Ready Features:
- **Auto-scaling**: HPA scales pods based on CPU/memory
- **Self-healing**: Failed pods are automatically restarted
- **Rolling updates**: Deploy new versions without downtime
- **Load balancing**: Traffic distributed across pod replicas
- **Health checks**: Kubernetes monitors service health
- **Resource limits**: Prevents services from consuming too many resources
- **Persistent storage**: Shared database across all pods
- **Ingress routing**: External access with path-based routing

### Observability:
```bash
# Monitor your services
kubectl get pods                    # See all running pods
kubectl top pods                    # Resource usage
kubectl logs -f deployment/issuer   # Real-time logs
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>     # Detailed pod info
```

### Scaling:
```bash
# Manual scaling
kubectl scale deployment issuer-deployment --replicas=10

# Auto-scaling (already configured)
# Scales automatically based on CPU/memory usage
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Development (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
# Access: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Production (Kubernetes)
```bash
./deploy.sh
# Access: via ingress or port-forwarding
```

### 3. Cloud (Kubernetes + Cloud Provider)
- **AWS EKS**: Managed Kubernetes with ALB ingress
- **Google GKE**: Managed Kubernetes with Google Load Balancer
- **Azure AKS**: Managed Kubernetes with Azure Load Balancer

## Migration Path

You can easily move between deployment methods:

1. **Start with Docker Compose** for development
2. **Test with Minikube** for local Kubernetes experience
3. **Deploy to Cloud Kubernetes** for production

All using the same container images!

## Assignment Compliance

Your Kubernetes setup meets all requirements:

✅ **Independent Services**: Separate deployments for issuer/verifier  
✅ **Scalability**: HPA auto-scales based on load  
✅ **Worker Identification**: Pod names used as worker IDs  
✅ **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes services distribute traffic  
✅ **High Availability**: Multiple replicas with PDBs  
✅ **Persistent Storage**: Shared database via PVC  
✅ **Health Monitoring**: Liveness and readiness probes  
✅ **Production Ready**: Resource limits, ingress, monitoring  

The Kubernetes deployment demonstrates enterprise-level container orchestration skills that are highly valued in the industry!
